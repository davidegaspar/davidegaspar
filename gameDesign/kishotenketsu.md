## Ki (Introduction)

_The first act sets the scene by introducing characters, setting, and context. This foundation establishes the basic elements needed to understand the story._

## Shō (Development)

_In this act, the narrative expands and deepens, providing more details about the established elements. The development builds upon the introduction without introducing major changes._

## Ten (Twist)

_This crucial third act presents an unexpected turn or revelation that re-contextualizes the previous events. The twist doesn't necessarily create conflict but rather offers a new perspective or understanding._

## Ketsu (Conclusion)

_The final act brings closure to the narrative by connecting the twist with the previous elements, creating a satisfying resolution_
